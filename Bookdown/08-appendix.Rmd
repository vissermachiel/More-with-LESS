# Interactive Dashboard and R Code {#appendix-d}

All plots resulting from the simulation studies and experiments on real datasets are put together in an interactive dashboard, which can be downloaded from GitHub: 

[https://github.com/vissermachiel/More-with-LESS](https://github.com/vissermachiel/More-with-LESS)

The dashboard with interactive plots makes it possible to (de)select each classifier in these figures in order to better compare a subset of certain classifiers of interest. The R code of the LESS classifier and the functions for the discussed variable scaling methods can also be found in this online repository.
